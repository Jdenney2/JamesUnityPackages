# JamesUnityPackages
 A repo made to store any unity packages that I make for future use.

Included Packages:

Event System: A simple package that uses the properties of unity's scriptable objects to implement a game event system. 

FPS Package: A set of scripts that handle a great deal of the setup for an fps game, while still leaving plenty of room to tweak and alter things to suit your needs. I've tried to avoid the scripts being dependent on one another, and to a good extent, most of the scripts should be easily removed or replaced.
    Dependencies: Event System
